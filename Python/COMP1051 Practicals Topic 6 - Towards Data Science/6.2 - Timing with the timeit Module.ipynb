    "Now we see that the linear pattern is not quite as clear. The likely reason is that our assumption the line of code inside the for loop `x += x % 991` is independent of `x` may not be quite true. In fact, most modulo algorithms have complexity $O((log(n))^2)$, so the time required to calculate the modulo will grow with larger values of `x`. This suggests our algorithm probably has complexity of $O(n*(log(n))^2)$, so scales slightly worse than linear. \n",
