    "In the process of developing code, there are often trade-offs you can make between various implementations.\n",
    "Early in developing your algorithm, it can be counterproductive to worry about such things, and we have not worried about it until now. As Donald Knuth famously quipped, \"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you have your code working, it can be useful to dig into its efficiency a bit.\n",
    "Sometimes it's useful to check the execution time of a given command or set of commands; other times it's useful to dig into a multiline process and determine where the bottleneck lies in some complicated series of operations.\n",
    "IPython provides access to a wide array of functionality for this kind of timing and profiling of code.\n",
    "Here we'll discuss the following IPython magic commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``%time``: Time the execution of a single statement\n",
    "- ``%timeit``: Time repeated execution of a single statement for more accuracy\n",
    "- ``%prun``: Run code with the profiler\n",
    "- ``%lprun``: Run code with the line-by-line profiler\n",
    "- ``%memit``: Measure the memory use of a single statement\n",
    "- ``%mprun``: Run code with the line-by-line memory profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The last four commands are not bundled with IPython by default – you may need to install the ``line_profiler`` and ``memory_profiler`` modules to use these on your own installation. Note that these magic functions using the `%` symbol are available to us here in Jupyter because they are provided by IPython, but these will not work in regular Python environments. There are alternative ways to use these modules without using magic functions, but we will not cover those methods here. Unfortunately, as you will see later in this notebook, the memory_profiler module has fallen into a state of disrepair over the past couple of years and some of its functionality no longer works under Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Anaconda on your own machine and need to install these packages it can be easily done from the Anaconda Navigator. If you open the Navigator, and click on *Environments* in the left hand menu you should be presented with a list of packages already installed. If you change the dropdown at the top to *Not Installed* and then search for any of the packages below you will be able to select the package you wish to install and hit the *Apply* button in the bottom right of the Navigator."

    "\n",
    "We can use the ``%timeit`` line-magic and ``%%timeit`` cell-magic to time the repeated execution of snippets of code. We can place the `%timeit` command in front of any line of Python code to time how long it takes to run just that single line. We use the `%%timeit` command to time all of the code within a particular Jupyter cell. The code below may take a little while to run. So long as you can see the `In [*]` on the left hand side it should be doing something useful."

Each of those runs consisted of 1000000 loops, so we repeated this line of code 1000000 times in each of our 7 runs. The runtime of 1.36 microseconds is the average runtime of those 7 runs divided by 1000000, meaning each run took about 1.36 seconds, and our 7 runs take around 10 seconds.
