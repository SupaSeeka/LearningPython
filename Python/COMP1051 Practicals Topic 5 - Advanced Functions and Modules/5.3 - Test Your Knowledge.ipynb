Lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets are all collection types, they can store other objects, including other collection types. We saw this in the content in notebook 5.2 looking at lists and lists of lists. Create examples of your own where you try to copy and edit these data structures. Make sure to consider compound data structures - we saw lists of lists in the content, so try for example copying and editing a tuple of lists, or a set of tuples."

If the filename the user provides is invalid you should print out a message to indicate this, and then request another filename. If the filename is valid then you should read in the file and print out its contents. You should use the `try` and `except` structure, and will probably need a `while` loop."
