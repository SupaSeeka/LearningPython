    "We've seen from the previous topic that we can define our own functions and call them from anywhere in our code and as many time as we like, which is fantastic for avoiding code repetition. There are two obvious generalisations of this that we can consider. The first is that you can call one function from within a different function, and this sounds like quite a natural thing to want to do. The other useful aspects of functions is their ability to call themselves, or more specifically, you can call a function from within that function. This is known as a recursive function and tends to be a source of much confusion to those just starting out with programming. It is very easy to get recursion wrong, and end up with either very slow programs, or maybe one that never terminates. \n",

The process only stops once the value of `n` has incremented to 10 and we stop calling the function.\n",
