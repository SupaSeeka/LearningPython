    "This subtopic outlines techniques for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python.\n",
    "Datasets can come from a wide range of sources and in a wide range of formats, such as collections of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else.\n",
    "Despite this apparent heterogeneity, it will help us to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, digital images can be thought of as simply two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area.\n",
    "Sound clips can be thought of as one-dimensional arrays of intensity versus time.\n",
    "Text can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps binary digits representing the frequency of certain words or pairs of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science, machine learning or scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (short for *Numerical Python*) provides such an efficient interface to store and operate on numerical arrays.\n",
    "In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in ``list`` type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size.\n",
    "NumPy arrays form the core of many tools and modules in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what programming tasks you attempt in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running Jupyter on your own Anaconda install you should check that you have NumPy installed prior to working through this notebook and the following one. If not, you should follow the instructions given in previous topics to install NumPy via the Anaconda Navigator. You can check that NumPy is installed, by running the following code:"
