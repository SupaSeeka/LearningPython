In this section we will see how to use those variables in expressions and as operands to simple operators. This will allow us to do useful computation for the first time in our code.

If you change any of the values to a float, you will find that the output is also a float. Python does this to avoid losing any precision in the result, as adding a float to an int will likely result in a number that has a fractional element, and the only way to guarantee being able to output that number is to make it a float. Technically what happens is Python \"upcasts\" the int to a float, that is it changes the int value into a float, and adds together two floats to output a float.   "
