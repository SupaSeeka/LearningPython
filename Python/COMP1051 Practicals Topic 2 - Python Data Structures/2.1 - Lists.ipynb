    "Lists are the most important data structure available to you in Python. You should make sure you are comfortable and confident with using lists before you continue with the remainder of the course. This is a long notebook, and may take you the majority of the practical session if this is your first time learning Python. Take your time, and make sure you understand everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an ordered collection of data, and each element can be any of the types we have seen in the previous topic, so a list can contain any combination of `int`, `float`, `bool` or `str` elements. Lists are ordered data structures, which means the order of the elements contained in the list is fixed, unless you explicitly change the order of elements yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous topic that all of the basic data types are immutable, but the list is a mutable data structure - so we can edit them without creating a new Python object! We can modify the individual elements of a list, we can add and remove elements and manually change the order of elements if we wish. We'll see examples of each of these operations in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first start by creating a new list - we define a list as a sequence of comma separated values enclosed in square brackets. We use the `=` sign to assign the list to the variable `L`."

If we leave out the `stop` value, Python will default this to `len(L)`, and if we leave out the `step` value, Python will default this to `1`.
