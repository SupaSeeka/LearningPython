    "Our third useful data structure provided to us by Python is the dictionary. This again is very similar to a list, both data structures are mutable, so we can add, remove and modify data as we please. Both data types can be nested, so a dictionary can contain another dictionary as one of its elements, or a list or tuple for that matter too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, the main difference between these data structures was that a dictionary was not ordered, so it made no difference to us in which order we added elements to a dictionary. However, in Python version 3.7 and later, this has changed, and a dictionary will now preserve the order in which you add elements. In general this is nothing to worry about, so much so, that we will not mention this again.\n",

You can imagine this data a little like an Excel spreadsheet, where you have two columns. In the first column is the name of the settlement, and in the second column is its population. If you wanted to know the population of a particular settlement, you would look for its name in the first column, and read the value from the second column.

    "Again, you might be asking yourself, when would I ever use a dictionary when writing a Python program? The answer to this one is quite easy, there are two main reasons for using a dictionary:\n",
    "1. When I want to store related data, much like when we would use multiple columns in a spreadsheet. In my example the key and value are related, so this data structure makes much more sense than using two lists for example where one contains the settlement names and other other contains the populations. We could use a list of tuples, except...\n",
    "2. If I want to find some data in this key-value form it is much faster to search a dictionary than to search other data structures such as a list of tuples. This is due to the use of Hash Tables, which we won't go into here, but if you're studying Algorithms and Data Structures you will be learning all about them this term."
