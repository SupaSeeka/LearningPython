    "Loops in programming give us an option to repeat a section of code, either for a fixed number of times, or more generally until a certain condition is met. Python gives us two keywords for creating loops in our code, and they are `for` and `while`. In most situations you can use these interchangeably, however the usual convention is to use a for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat the execution of your code block (i.e. you repeat things a fixed number of times) and use a while loop when repeating a code block for an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.\n"

We could do this just using the indexing operator that we have seen previously, but that requires us knowing the size of the list in advance to make sure we have enough print statements to print out every element. However, using a for loop it won't matter how many elements are in our list, Python will handle things for us."

The object to the right of `in` in our code is a list, and a list is an example of an iterable object in Python.

Once we've used all of the elements of the list, we move on to the non-indented code that follows the for loop.\n",

Notice that we still have a condition on our while loop, but the condition this time is just the boolean value `True`. This implies that this loop will run forever, as the condition will always be true! So the only way we can end this while loop is to trigger the break. You should take care using this method, as this is often how people end up with loops that never terminate! You have to make sure that at some point in time the break will eventually be triggered.
