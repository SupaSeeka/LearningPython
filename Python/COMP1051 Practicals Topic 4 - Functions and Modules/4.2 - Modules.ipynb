    "Modules can be considered an extension of functions in Python. They are generally collections of functions that focus on a particular problem domain. For example, the module called `random`, that we will look at shortly, provides a collection of functions that perform useful tasks for us such as generating random integers and floats. Often these are designed in order to provide improved computational performance for common tasks, with a number of modules actually being written in the C programming language, which tends to be very computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see references made to 'packages' in Python, and these are collections of modules. In reality, most people use the terms modules and packages interchangeably, despite the fact they are technically different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a number of 'built-in' modules, and we will look briefly at how to use some of the most useful ones in this notebook such as `random`, `math`, and `copy`. If you're interested you can see the full list of built-in modules here: https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of Python however is the huge number of third party packages available! As you work through your degree you are likely to use a large number of these third party packages, such as matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Pygame, PyTorch and TensorFlow to name just a few. The standard repository for these packages is the Python Package Index (PyPI) which you can find here: https://pypi.org/\n",

    "Using this Jupyter notebook server on NCC you won't be able to install your own additional packages, that is controlled by the system admin. However, if you are using the generic NCC Jupyter server http://ncc1.clients.dur.ac.uk/COMP0000 or running Python locally on your own machine you will be able to use virtual environments and \"pip install\" packages of your choice, but we won't cover that in this particular topic. If you want to know more about installing packages on your own machine the demonstrators should be able to point you in the right direction. \n",

For example, if you're interested in simulating the flip of a coin, you might say that random floats above 0.5 represent a head, whereas values below 0.5 represent a tail. You should be careful with the exact conditions to make sure the chances of each event occuring are fair!

    "By this point you might be wondering, how does Python actually provide us with random numbers? The answer is that it doesn't really.... What Python actually returns are pseudo-random numbers, so numbers that look and behave like random numbers, but they are infact generated by a mathematical function. If that function uses the same input value, it would produce the same random number every time, as strange as that sounds. This input value is generally provided by the operating system, and the classical method is to use the current time from the system clock. If we want to we can override this behaviour, and provide our own seed. This allows us to generate a reproducible random number, which can often be useful if we're trying to test various algorithms on the same random input list for example. To do this we can provide an argument to the `seed` function of the random module."
