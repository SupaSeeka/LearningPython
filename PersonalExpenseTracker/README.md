## Features breakdown
### Input of expenses
The input of expenses will be fairly simple. It will take information such as ammount, date and catagory.

To begin, this will be a simple command line, later to be developed into a user interface.

### Persistent storage

Not sure how to do this just yet. Save file somewhere and read/write from this file?

### User Interface

Fairly simple but will be similar to web form. Takes data and will store it in a database.

### Graphs

This can be implemented using numpy. To be sorted once UI is done.

### Setting budget

This will also be stored persistently. Written to an external file. In setup phase, write to a file with preferences such as weekly spending etc.
